# JMU First-year Advising Schedule Viewer

This project provides a more fully featured schedule viewer for student schedules that can 
be used for summer springboard advising sessions. It includes additional helpful information like, 
"There is not enough time scheduled for the walk between WRTC103 in Miller Hall 2110 (Bluestone Area) and 
CS101 in ISAT/CS Building 0136 (Lower Skyline Area)" and automatically catalogs students who do not yet have
a schedule, have too few hours, or are taking courses that cannot be taken together.
